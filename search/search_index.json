A database is typically used to allow long-running processes to execute multiple transactions involving multiple resource managers using two-phase commit to ensure Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable (ACID) properties. Adoption of one data source per microservice negates ACID semantics and poses a challenge to the support of long-running transactions across microservices. With an event backbone at the heart of event-driven architecture, two-phase commit is no longer viable. Enter the Saga Pattern. Introduced in a 1987 paper by Hector Garcia-Molina and Kenneth Salem , the Saga pattern is designed to support long-running transactions that can be further broken down into a collection of sub-transactions which can be interleaved with other transactions in multiple ways. With microservices, each transaction updates data within a single service and each subsequent step may be triggered by the previous completion. Implementation Explained \u00b6 We have implemented the SAGA pattern in the Reefer Container Shipment Reference Application for the scenario where a customer creates an order to carry fresh goods from an origin port to a destination port. We have seen that the Choreograhy variant of the Saga Pattern leverages Kafka and there is strong decoupling of services as each participant listens to events and acts on them independently. Each service has at least one topic representing states on its own entities. In contrast, the Orchestration variant of the Saga Pattern specifies an Orchestrator that coordinates things across all participating microservices (much like an Orchestra Conductor). The Orchestrator goes into service after it receives a command from a caller. Using commands and evaluating responses to those commands, the Orchestration Saga implements a sequence of service calls by issuing commands to participating microservices. Every successful command results in a transition to the command. A command failure causes the Saga to transition into a Compensation sequence where previously completed commands are rolled back. In the figure below the saga is managed in the context of the order microservice in one of the business function like createOrder . The figure above shows that each services uses its own topic in Kafka. In order to manage the saga, the Order service needs to listen to transaction outcomes from all participants. Happy Path \u00b6 The happy path is illustrated in the diagram below: Upon the request to create an order, the OrderServiceSaga creates an order and sends an OrderCreatedEvent to the event broker. The Saga receives an acknowledgement that the event has been successfully published and gives the caller a new Order ID. The next order of things is to reserve a voyage. The Saga issues the command ReserveVoyageCmd. The VoyagerMS microservice consumes this event which causes it to reserve a voyage. With a voyage successfully reserved, VoyagerMS sends a VoyageAllocatedEvent to signal successful completion. The saga consumes this event which prompts it to transition to the next activity With a voyage booked we now need a reefer. The Saga reserves a reefer by issuing a ReserveReeferCmd command. The ContainerMS is in charge of reefer reservations. It verifies availability of reefers, grabs a reefer and responds with a ReeferReservedEvent. At this point all microservices have successfully executed and the saga ends the transaction with an OrderAssignedEvent. Error Path with Compensation \u00b6 Code Repositories \u00b6 The new implementation of the services is done using Quarkus and Microprofile Messaging.

Compensation \u00b6 The SAGA pattern comes with the tradeoff that a compensation process must also be implemented in the case that one, or multiple, of the sub transactions fails or does not achieve to complete so that the system rolls back to the initial state before the transaction began. In our specific case, a new order creation transaction can fail either because we can not find a refrigerator container to be allocated to the order or we can not find a voyage to assigned to the order. No container \u00b6 When a new order creation is requested by a customer but there is not a container to be allocated to such order, either because the container(s) do not have enough capacity or there is no container available in the origin port for such order, the compensation process for the order creation transaction is quite simple. The order microservice will not get an answer from the reefer manager, anf after a certain time it will trigger the compensation flow by sending a OrderUpdate with status onHold. The voyage service which may has responded positively before that, may roll back the order to voyage relationship. No voyage \u00b6 This case is the sysmetric of the other one. The actions flow remains as expected for the SAGA transaction until the Voyages microservice is not answering after a time period or answering negatively. As a result, the Order Command microservice will transition the order to OnHold and emit an OrderUpdateEvent to inform the saga participants. In this case, the Reefer manager is one of those interested parties as it will need to kick off the compensation task, which in this case is nothing more than de-allocate the container to the order to make it available for any other coming order. Run locally \u00b6 In this repository, we have define a docker compose file that let you run the demonstration on your local computer. You need podman or docker and docker compose. docker-compose up -d Happy path demonstration \u00b6 Execute the create order ./e2e/sendGoodOrder.sh { \"orderID\" : \"GoodOrder02\" , \"productID\" : \"P01\" , \"customerID\" : \"Customer01\" , \"quantity\" : 70 , \"pickupAddress\" :{ \"street\" : \"1st main street\" , \"city\" : \"San Francisco\" , \"country\" : \"USA\" , \"state\" : \"CA\" , \"zipcode\" : \"95051\" }, \"pickupDate\" : null , \"destinationAddress\" :{ \"street\" : \"1st horizon road\" , \"city\" : \"Shanghai\" , \"country\" : \"CH\" , \"state\" : \"S1\" , \"zipcode\" : \"95051\" }, \"expectedDeliveryDate\" : null , \"creationDate\" : \"2022-05-16\" , \"updateDate\" : \"2022-05-16\" , \"status\" : \"pending\" } Verify in Kafdrop the orders topic contains the expected CreateOrder event chrome https://localhost:9000 Verify in Kafdrop the reefers topic Verify the voyages topic The ShippingOrder should now be in assigned state as the order manager receives the two positive answers from the saga participant. Trigger the compensation tasks \u00b6 The order has a pickup city set to Boston, and there is no reefer available at that location at that time, so the Reefer service is not responding to the order. The order microservice has two timers for each topics it subscribes to. If those timer sets, it looks at existing pending orders and trigget an OrderUpdateEvent with status onHold. Send an order from Boston ./e2e/sendNonPossibleOrder.sh Verify order created event reaches voyage and reefer microservices Voyage generates a event for voyages allocated.
